## I make use of OpenCV in C++ with Visual studio 2012 to achieve the following image processing:
## 1.  SIFT
## 2.  Background Subtraction
## 3.  Optical Flow tracking
   ### 3.1 Preprocessing 
   ### 3.2 Tracking whole video 
## 4. Face Recognition & Detection 
   ###4.1 Face Recognition 
   ###4.2 Face Detection 
   ###4.3 Face Detection + Recognition 
   
## For the details of each image processing result, please refer to the PPT,"OpenCV image processing request".
